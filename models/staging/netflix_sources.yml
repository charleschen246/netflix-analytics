        description: "The dataset covers user behaviour on Netflix from users in the UK to opted-in to have their anonymized browsing activity tracked. 
                      It only includes desktop and laptop activity (which Netflix estimate is around 25% of global traffic) and is for a fixed window of time (January 2017 to June 2019, inclusive). It documents each time someone in our tracked panel in the UK clicked on a Netflix.com/watch URL for a movie.'Duration' shows how long it was (in seconds) until that user clicked on another URL. A watch time of zero seconds means they visited the page but instantly clicked away."
